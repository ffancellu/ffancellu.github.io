  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/">Bonnie Webber</a> and <a href="https://alopez.github.io">Adam Lopez</a>.
  My work focuses on different problems related to automatically detecting and representing negation for NLP. Few of the research questions that have been bugging me are:
  <ul>
    <li>Can we build better and simpler negation scope detection system for Information Extraction applications (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1047.pdf">ACL2016</a>)...</li>
    <li>... and what is that these systems learn from the data we feed them? (EACL2017-to appear) </li>
    <li>Can we improve the performance of MT systems on negation? (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E14/E14-1063.pdf">EACL2014</a>, Ex-Prom2015)</li>
    <li>Can we represent negation scope on top of existing, widely-used resources? (ArXiv-to appear) </li>
  </ul>
</p>

  Previously, I have worked (and enjoyed working!) for CNGL(now <a href="http://adapt.ie">ADAPT</a>)@TCD as an NLP research engineer.

I have a soft spot for East Asian Languages I have been studying and researching for a decade now.
I am still (occasionally) a Korean-to-Italian translator.
