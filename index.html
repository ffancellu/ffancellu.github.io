<p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Edinburgh where I am researching in the field of Statistical Machine Translation under the supervision of Prof. <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/">Bonnie Webber</a> and <a href="https://alopez.github.io">Adam Lopez</a>. My work focuses on building systems for cross-lingual negation detection and their application to Machine Translation</p>
<p>In the year in between the completion of my MSc and the beginning of my Ph.D. I have worked (and enjoyed working!) for <a href="http://adaptcentre.ie/">CNGL(now ADAPT)@TCD</a> as an NLP research engineer.</p>
<p>I have a soft spot for East Asian Languages I have been studying and researching for a decade now.</p>
<p>I am still (occasionally) a Korean-to-Italian translator.</p>
