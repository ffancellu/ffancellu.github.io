  I am currently a PostDoc at the University of Edinburgh working with <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/">Mirella Lapata</a>
  on multilingual semantic parsing. My work focuses in particular on the relation between Universal Dependencies and Logical Form.
</p>
<p>
  I recently received my Ph.D. from the University of Edinburgh under the supervision of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/">Bonnie Webber</a> and <a href="https://alopez.github.io">Adam Lopez</a>.
  My Ph.D. thesis explored different problems related to automatically detecting and representing negation for NLP in a cross-lingual setting.
</p>
<p>
  Before starting my Ph.D. I have worked (and enjoyed working!) for CNGL(now <a href="http://adapt.ie">ADAPT</a>)@TCD as an NLP research engineer.
</p>
<p>
  I have a soft spot for East Asian Languages I have been studying and researching for a decade now.
