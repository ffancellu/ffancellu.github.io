<p>
  I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Edinburgh where I am researching in the field of Statistical Machine Translation under the supervision of <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/bonnie/">Bonnie Webber</a> and <a href="alopez.github.io">Adam Lopez</a>. My work focuses on cross-lingual automatic negation detection and its application to Machine Translation.
</p>
<p>
  In the year in between the completion of my MSc and the beginning of my Ph.D. I have worked (and enjoyed working!) for CNGL@TCD as an NLP research engineer.
</p>
<p>
I have a soft spot for East Asian Languages I have been studying and researching for a decade now.
I am still (occasionally) a Korean-to-Italian translator.
