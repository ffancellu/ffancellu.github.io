Few of the research questions that have been bugging me are:
<ul>
  <li>Can we build better and simpler negation scope detection system for Information Extraction applications (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1047.pdf">ACL2016</a>)...</li>
  <li>... and what is that these systems learn from the data we feed them? (EACL2017-to appear) </li>
  <li>Can we improve the performance of MT systems on negation? (<a href="https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/E/E14/E14-1063.pdf">EACL2014</a>, <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W15-1301">Ex-Prom2015</a>)</li>
  <li>Can we represent negation scope on top of existing, widely-used resources? (ArXiv-to appear) </li>
</ul>
